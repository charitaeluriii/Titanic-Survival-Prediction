# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
A predictive model to analyze survival outcomes of Titanic passengers using machine learning
# Titanic Survival Prediction Model
## Description
This project aims to predict the survival outcomes of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic based on various socio-demographic features. Using a Random Forest Classifier, the model analyzes historical passenger data to identify patterns associated with survival.
## Project Goals
- Analyze historical passenger data to understand key survival factors.
- Build an accurate predictive model to classify the survival rates of passengers.
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
## Installation
To run this project, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
(pip install pandas scikit-learn)
## Usage
1. Download the datasets `train.csv` and `test.csv` from the repository.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook using:

jupyter notebook titanic_prediction.ipynb

## Results
- Validation accuracy achieved:0.8044692737430168
- Key factors influencing survival included age, gender, and socio-economic class.
## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
## Acknowledgments
- Inspired by the Titanic competition on Kaggle.
